# Reaction-Role
This is an old project of mine that may not work today but oh well, it was working some time ago.

Documentation is here: https://heartbeatdev.gitbook.io/getting-started/our-projects

I had great plans but when I finished it I realized that maintining it won't be as fun as writing it at the first place. 
Especially considering that it was written in discordJS v13 and migrating it to v14 to avoid deprecation would require massive changes.

Nontheless it was fun learing expirience :)
